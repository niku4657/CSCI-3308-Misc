Creating Tables and Inserting Data:

CREATE TABLE competing_universities(name VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY, date_established to_date() NOT NULL, address VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, student_population INTEGER NOT NULL, acceptance_rate REAL NOT NULL);

INSERT INTO competing_universities(name, date_established, address, student_population, acceptance_rate)
VALUES('CU Boulder',to_date('1876','YYYY'), '1100 28th St,Boulder, CO 80303', 35000, 0.80);


Query Basics:

SELECT name, major FROM football_players ORDER BY major;

SELECT name, rushing_yards FROM football_players WHERE rushing_yards >= 70;

SELECT * FROM football_games WHERE visitor_name = 'Nebraska';

SELECT * FROM football_games WHERE home_score > visitor_score;

SELECT visitor_name, game_date FROM football_games WHERE game_date > '2018-09-01' and game_date < '2018-12-31';

SELECT CAST(SUM(home_score)as float)/CAST(COUNT(home_score) as float) as "avg" FROM football_games;

SELECT DISTINCT(major), COUNT(major) AS number_of_players FROM football_players GROUP BY major;

SELECT DISTINCT(major), COUNT(major) AS number_of_players FROM football_players WHERE major = 'CSCI' GROUP BY major;


Views and SubQueries:

CREATE VIEW games_won AS SELECT COUNT(*) FROM football_games WHERE visitor_score < home_score;

CREATE VIEW games_played AS SELECT COUNT(visitor_name) FROM football_games;

SELECT (SELECT COUNT FROM games_won) * (100.0) / (SELECT COUNT FROM games_played);


Handling Joins:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM football_games WHERE(SELECT id FROM football_players WHERE id = 1) = ANY(players);

CREATE VIEW cedric_games AS SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM football_games WHERE(SELECT id FROM football_players WHERE id = 1) = ANY(players);

CREATE VIEW cedric_yards AS SELECT SUM(rushing_yards) AS r_yards FROM football_players WHERE(id = 1);

SELECT (SELECT COUNT FROM cedric_yards) * (100.0) / (SELECT COUNT FROM cedric_games);
